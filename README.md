Objective C IRCBot
==================

A IRC Bot written completely in Objective C.  
Still needs lots of changes to make it function but I'm getting there.

Uses:
*	AsyncSocket, to connect to the irc server.
*	EMKeychain, to store the login details.
*	RegexKitLite, to parse the irc messages.
*	BWToolkitFramework, for several UI elements.
