Objective C IRCBot
==================

A IRC Bot written completely in Objective C.  
Still needs lots of changes to make it function but I'm getting there.  


###Uses:
[AsyncSocket](http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/), to connect to the irc server.  
[EMKeychain](http://extendmac.com/EMKeychain/), to store the login details.  
[RegexKitLite](http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/), to parse the irc messages.  
[BWToolkitFramework](http://www.brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/), for several UI elements.
