An IRC Bot written mainly in Objective C.
It still needs lots of changes to make it fully functional.

Features include:

- Lua Actions that are triggered by irc messages.

### IRCBot Uses:
[AsyncSocket](http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/), to connect to the irc server.  
[EMKeychain](http://extendmac.com/EMKeychain/), to store the login details.  
[RegexKitLite](http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/), to parse the irc messages.  
[LuaCocoa](http://playcontrol.net/opensource/LuaCocoa/), to execute the lua actions.  
[BWToolkitFramework](http://www.brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/), for several UI elements.
